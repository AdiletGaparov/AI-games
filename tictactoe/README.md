## Play Tic-Tac-Toe against AI (read: unlimited Minimax algorithm) :)

First, install pygame through 
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` or simply ```pip3 install pygame```

The pygame code (runner.py file) was written by instructors of Harvard University's CS50's Introduction to AI with Python (https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/projects/0/tictactoe/). 
The algorithm to play Tic-Tac-Toe (tictactoe.py) was written by me. 

To run the game, just type in the terminal
```python runner.py```
